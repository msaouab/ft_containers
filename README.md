# ft_containers

# Objectives
 - In this project, you will implement a few container types of the C++ standard template library.
 - You have to take the structure of each standard container as reference. If a part of the Orthodox Canonical form is missing in it, do not implement it.

## Mandatory Part

- In this part, you must implement a Vector and Map for 80 points 'you can validate this project just with 80 points, If you need to have all 100 points for the mandatory part you must add a stack.

## Bonus Part

# Testing
- in Folder `Testers/` we have a files `.cpp` to test all containers and compared with original containers.
	- if you need to test vector use `make vector && ./my_vector`
	- if you need to test map use `make map && ./my_map`
	- if you need to test set use `make set && ./my_set`
	- if you need to test stack use `make stack && ./my_stack`
	- if you need to test red-black tree use `make rb_tree && ./my_rb_tree`
	- if you need to test for iterators containers use `make it && ./my_it`
	- if you need to test timing of the containers use `make && ./my_containers 1`
