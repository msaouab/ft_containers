# ft_containers

# Objectives
 - In this project, you will implement a few container types of the C++ standard template library.
 - You have to take the structure of each standard container as reference. If a part of the Orthodox Canonical form is missing in it, do not implement it.

## Mandatory Part

- In this part, you must implement a Vector and Map for 80 points 'you can validate this project just with 80 points, If you need to have all 100 points for the mandatory part you must add a stack.

## Bonus Part

# Testing
- in Folder `Testers/` we have a files `.cpp` to test all containers and compared with original containers.
	- if you need to test vector use `c++ Testers/vectortest.cpp`
	- if you need to test map use `c++ Testers/mapTester.cpp`
	- if you need to test set use `c++ Testers/setTester.cpp`
	- if you need to test stack use `c++ Testers/stacktest.cpp`
	- if you need to test red-black tree use `c++ Testers/testrbt.cpp`
	- if you need to test for xtra containers use `c++ Testers/xtraTest.cpp`
